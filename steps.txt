Hello :)

First thing we need to do is to set our routes.
We need to set our routes to GET & POST.

Now we need to create a controller.
Inside of our controller create a index method.

Now Let's set up our .env file.

Behind the scene i already create my page.
In developers.facebook.com you need to create your appid.
Create a test app for messenger.
Select the page that you create.
Copy the page access token and paste it on .env file

Not let's set up our webhooks.
in terminal we need to set our local server.
i am using laravel valet so that i can share it.
Copy the https:// url.
We set up our web hook, we need to subscribe to page that we create.

We can now set up a bot message.

Let's except the route that we create in verifycsrftoken
Now it's working.

Thanks for watching.
